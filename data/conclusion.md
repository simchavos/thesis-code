# What do you think?
Do you think my analysis is correct, do these recommendations help you? Or have I missed something?

For my master's thesis I'm doing research into the use of automations in GitHub repositories. With my findings, I want to see if I can help out developers with what automations they could focus on. Do you want to help me out? **Leaving a response is much appreciated!**

If you have any other Java/Maven projects you'd like analyzed, you can send me the repositories and I can analyze them for you!
