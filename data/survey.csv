If your organization takes automation seriously, there is no reason you can't pull in the majority of automations from day 1, standardizing your workflow and ensuring code correctness. Even in the open source world, package skeletons exist that include many automation tasks that take minimal configuration to get going because of how easy GitHub actions are to configure. For example https://github.com/spatie/package-skeleton-laravelSo there are definitely some things that I would only expect to see in very mature organizations, but there is no reason they wouldn't then apply those automations immediately to any new repositories.
